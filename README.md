## PETase Variant Km Predictors 


PETase is an enzyme found in Ideonella sakaiensis bacteria. Its main function is to digest polyethylene terephthalate (PET), plastic commonly used to package food and beverages. 

By optimizing PETase efficiency, we can increase its potential for industrial usage to degrade plastic and, therefore, reduce plastic pollution.
